My full name is Aliaa Ahmed Farouk. I graduated from the faculty of Computer Science and AI, Helwan University. 
My graduation project was a website called an Online College, which aims to help students access college materials easily. 

I am a Software Engineer interested in the web field, so I am constantly learning web languages to develop my skills to become a full-stack developer.

I love drawing and reading and learning new things. 
I love writing my goals, arranging my thoughts, and planning to achieve those goals.

When I was in college, I volunteered in a student activity called Minders, As a member in Academic community I was responsible for explaining college subjects 
to my friends and making summaries for them to facilitate the study process and pass the exam easily. As a leader, I used to distribute tasks to members, 
monitor their work and ensure that these tasks were completed after the deadline.
